## 🚀 About Me

I'm a software engineer with a focus on building **scalable**, **secure**, and **production-ready** backend systems. I’m always optimizing for performance, developer experience, and uptime.

I’ve handled (and still handle) several servers, managed backend infrastructure for real-world users, deployed background workers, shipped Web3 applications, and kept mission-critical APIs fast, resilient, and production-ready under pressure.

I thrive on:

- Building clean and testable APIs
- Designing secure file encryption & streaming flows
- Writing modular services for large codebases
- Managing real-world infrastructure
- Creating tools that make other developers faster
